        <p>"After having my second child, I struggled to find time for exercise and healthy eating. I was tired, lacking energy, and felt disconnected from my pre-pregnancy self. FitTrack's flexible approach to fitness helped me start with just 20-minute workouts that I could fit into my busy schedule as a mom.</p>
        
        <p>What I appreciated most was how the trainers helped me focus on rebuilding my core strength safely. They designed a program specifically for postpartum recovery, which gave me confidence that I was exercising in a way that was right for my body."</p>

        <p>"I spent most of my day sitting at a desk, and years of this sedentary lifestyle had taken a toll on my health. I suffered from back pain, low energy, and poor sleep. When my doctor warned me about my rising blood pressure, I knew I needed to make a change.</p>
        
        <p>I started with FitTrack's Cardio Crusher program, barely able to run for 5 minutes straight. The progressive training plan was exactly what I needed - it challenged me without overwhelming me. What began as a health necessity turned into a passion for running, and ultimately led to me completing my first marathon."</p>
