<h1>About YHC</h1>
<p>Our privately-funded health clinic services include pediatric, 
chronic disease, prenatal, and general adult clinics accessible by public 
transportation. Our clinics are offered during the day and evening, making our 
services convenient for working families. Spanish-English translation is always available</p>

<h3>Volunteers Make it Work</h3>
<p>The Your Health Clinic would not exist without the efforts of our volunteers. 
Services are provided through a large corps of over 100 committed volunteers including 
doctors and other health professionals, translators, event volunteers and general support 
workers in unison with a small professional staff.</p>

<h3>Supporters Make it Happen</h3>
<p>Our facility and operating expenses are made possible by generous donations 
and grants from private and family foundations, as well as individual contributions 
and a per-visit patient donation. In order to serve all people seeking medical attention, 
regardless of their circumstances, the Your Health Clinic operates without Federal assistance. 
The only requirement a patient must meet to qualify for care is to be uninsured and to live within 
Summit or  Wasatch County.</p>

<h3>Membership Options</h3>

   <p>Your Health Club offers a variety of membership
      programs, including one sure to meet your specific
      needs and budget. Pick up a membership form at the club or 
      e-mail Ron Chi to request one.</p>
