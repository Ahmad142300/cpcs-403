<p>The Your Health Clinic operates largely with volunteer medical and auxiliary personnel. 
In 2009, doctors and other volunteers donated over 5,000 hours of their time, which was worth $180,000 
in medical services to Clinic patients!</p>

<p>Come be a part of it! We are always in need of more people to contribute 
their time and efforts during our Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday day and evening clinics. 
Volunteer opportunities vary based upon the needs of the clinic and the expertise of the volunteer. 
Training is available in some areas.</p>
