<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>The Your Health Clinic is a non-profit, primary care facility that provides
high-quality medical services to the uninsured individuals and families
in Summit and Wasatch Counties in Utah</p>
<p>We need your donations and your volunteer efforts now more than ever as access
 to healthcare becomes harder and harder to come by. The People’s Health Clinic treats 
 thousands of our neighbors in Summit and Wasatch Counties who would otherwise have nowhere else to turn.</p>
<blockquote><cite>From 700 patient visits in our first year, we grew to over 7,000 visits in 2010,
and saw a 30% increase in new patients</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Clinics are offered each week for general medical care, 
 chronic disease, pediatrics and prenatal care.  Patients are seen by appointment
  and a donation is requested at each visit, yet no one is turned away for inability to pay.</p>
