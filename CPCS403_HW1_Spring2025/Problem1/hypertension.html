    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>High blood pressure (hypertension) is often called a silent killer because you can have it for years without knowing it. In fact, about 50 million Americans have high blood pressure, but about 30 percent of them don't know it.
        Blood pressure is determined by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. Your blood pressure normally varies during the day. It can even vary slightly with each beat of your heart. It increases during activity and decreases with rest.
        Many people may not view high blood pressure as life-threatening. But uncontrolled high blood pressure can increase your risk of serious health problems. Fortunately, high blood pressure can be detected with a simple test � and once you know you have high blood pressure, you can work with your doctor to control it.

    <h1>Signs and symptoms</h1>
    <p>Most people with high blood pressure have no signs or symptoms, but people often think that headaches, dizziness or nosebleeds are common warning signs and symptoms of high blood pressure. It's true that a few people with early-stage high blood pressure have a dull ache in the back of their heads when they wake in the morning. Or perhaps they have a few more nosebleeds than normal.
        Headaches, dizziness or nosebleeds typically don't occur until high blood pressure has reached a more advanced stage � one that's possibly life-threatening. Even so, most people with the highest blood pressure readings don't experience any of these symptoms.
        Other signs and symptoms sometimes associated with high blood pressure generally are caused by other conditions that can lead to high blood pressure. Such signs and symptoms include:

    <ol>
        <li>  Excessive perspiration </li>
        <li>  Muscle cramps         </li>
        <li>Weakness</li>
        <li>  Frequent urination         </li>
        <li>  Rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)         </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Causes</h1>
   <p>The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure. A blood pressure reading consists of two numbers:</br>
    The top number indicates systolic pressure. This is the amount of pressure your heart generates when pumping blood out through your arteries.</br> 
    The bottom number indicates diastolic pressure. This is the amount of pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats. 
  The most recent guidelines for high blood pressure were issued in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in May 2003. The JNC represents a coalition of leaders from 46 professional, public, voluntary and federal health care agencies, including the American College of Cardiology, the American Diabetes Association, the American Heart Association, the American Public Health Association, the American Society of Hypertension, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. According to these guidelines, blood pressure for adults is classified as follows:
    Normal blood pressure. Your blood pressure is normal only if it's below 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), but some data indicate that 115/75 mm Hg should be the new gold standard. Once your blood pressure rises above that threshold, your risk of cardiovascular disease may begin to increase. 
    Prehypertension. Prehypertension is a systolic pressure ranging from 120 to 139 or a diastolic pressure ranging from 80 to 89. If your blood pressure is right at 120/80, you have prehypertension � your blood pressure isn't normal or optimal. 
    Stage 1 hypertension. This includes a systolic pressure ranging from 140 to 159 or a diastolic pressure ranging from 90 to 99. 
    Stage 2 hypertension. The most severe hypertension, this includes a systolic pressure of 160 or higher or a diastolic pressure of 100 or higher. 
  Only one of the numbers � the top or the bottom � needs to be high for you to have prehypertension or hypertension.
  In 90 percent to 95 percent of high blood pressure cases, there's no identifiable cause. This type of high blood pressure is called essential hypertension or primary hypertension. It differs from secondary hypertension, in which the increased pressure results from another underlying condition, such as:
